Remote Video Cam allows two android devices to stream video/audio to each other on the same LAN. The app needs to run on both devices.
When started, the app will automatically find the other device, and will start streaming video from its cam to it.
The user can select to be either in "camera" or "display" mode on each device. Both phones can be in "display" mode as well,
to see the other's camera view. The app can be used to monitor things in the house or in the yard, walkie-talkie, etc.
