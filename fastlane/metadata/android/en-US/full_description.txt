Remote Video Cam transforms two Android devices into a secure, portable audio/video streaming system. It works completely offline, using your local LAN, Wi-Fi Aware, or Wi-Fi Direct to establish a robust link between devices.

KEY FEATURES:
• Zero Configuration: Devices find each other automatically.
• Privacy First: No internet required. No external servers. Your video stays on your devices.
• Robust Connection: innovative connection logic that tries multiple methods (LAN, Wi-Fi Aware, Wi-Fi Direct) to ensure you stay connected.
• Modern Material 3 Design: A beautiful, easy-to-use interface built with the latest Android technologies.
• Two-Way Audio/Video: Use it as a baby monitor, home security cam, or walkie-talkie.

MODES:
• Camera Mode: Broadcasts video and audio.
• Display Mode: views the remote stream.

WARNING:
This app is for convenience only and is not a certified safety or medical monitoring device. Network connections can be unreliable. Please do not rely solely on this app for critical monitoring (like a baby monitor). We recommend placing a continuously moving object (like a clock) in the frame to verify the stream is active.
